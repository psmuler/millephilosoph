Build a better ecosystem of science and academia, together. We are inviting you to the &quot;Bento-kai,&quot; a lunchtime study group: As we aim to innovate further and enhance research capabilities, we face many daily challenges regarding the mechanisms of science and academia. To address these, efforts have begun actively across industry, government, and academia to form communities, design policies and systems, and develop services.   However, given the complexity of the challenges we face, you may experience difficulties and frustrations in your activities. We define endeavors that tackle challenges in science and academia as &quot;Metascience,&quot; and with the aim of sharing practical knowledge surrounding Metascience and building an organic space for connections among participants, we have launched &quot;Bento-kai,&quot; a &quot;brown-bag&quot; style study group.
