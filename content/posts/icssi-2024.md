title: "Scientists Have an Inherent Prioritized Queue in Selecting Collaborations"
excerpt: The paper analyzes the temporal dynamics of co-authorship in scientific publications, finding a fat-tailed interval distribution between recurring collaborations, which can be explained by a proposed priority selection model simulating multi-agent team dynamics based on co-authorship willingness. The findings suggest non-Poisson activity patterns in scientific collaborations.
